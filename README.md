# Weed Detection from .TIF Images using Otsu Thresholding

This project showcases a basic weed detection and segmentation technique using grayscale conversion and Otsu's thresholding on high-resolution `.tif` images. The analysis is focused on understanding the spatial distribution of weeds in agricultural fields using simple image processing techniques.

## 🌾 Description

Using remote sensing or drone-captured images, this notebook aims to:
- Preprocess `.tif` format images
- Convert images to grayscale
- Apply Otsu’s method for thresholding
- Visualize segmented weed regions
- Analyze the spatial distribution pattern of weeds

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
